# ETL_project
ETL Project: Urbanization, demographics and politics

In this project we create a database with political science data using data from data world, and fivethirtyeight.com. We used .csv files, which were cleaned 
using python, and archived in Postgresql. We made an ERD for the database using QuickDBD. We also used QuickDBD to generate SQL commands for table setup. We tested our 
database using SQL queries to make sure all tables could be joined correctly and queried independantly.
